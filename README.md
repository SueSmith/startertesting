# Glitch Starter Kit for Fastly Compute

[![Deploy to Fastly](https://deploy.edgecompute.app/button)](https://deploy.edgecompute.app/deploy)

This edge computing app transforms responses from an origin website on Glitch. You can use the default origin or remix the Glitch project to have your own version. The Glitch origin is accessible at: [origin-website.glitch.me](https://origin-website.glitch.me)

Your deployed version will be available at a Fastly domain ending: `edgecompute.app`

The edge code in the kit carries out the following enhancements on the origin site:

* Switch out the stylesheet so that the edge deployed site displays a different style to the origin site
* Display an indicator of the user location in the page
* Render JSON data from the origin as an HTML page by building it into synthetic content
